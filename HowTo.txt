This file briefly describes how to set up and run the project.

Step 1: Install the Floodlight VM
- The VM can be found here: https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/floodlightcontroller/Floodlight+VM
- Follow the rest of the directions on that page as well.

Step 2: Install sflow-rt
- http://www.sflow-rt.com/download.php
$ wget http://www.inmon.com/products/sFlow-RT/sflow-rt.tar.gz
$ tar -xvzf sflow-rt.tar.gz
* Also download the dashboard-example application
$ ./get-app.sh sflow-rt dashboard-example

Step 3: Download the mininet.js file 

Step 4: Run the application
- Run the following commands:
$ cd ~/floodlight
$ java -jar target/floodlight.jar

- Open a new terminal window and run this to open the mininet application
$ sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1,port=6653 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

- Open another new terminal window and run the following command to enable Sflow-rt. Note it is all one command.

$ sudo ovs-vsctl -- --id=@sflow create sflow agent=eth0  target=\"127.0.0.1:6343\" sampling=10 polling=20 -- -- set bridge s1 sflow=@sflow

- Start sflow-rt
$ cd sflow-rt
$ ./start.sh

- In the mininet application, run
> xterm h1 h2

- To create traffic, use the h1 node that just opened up and run
$ ping -f 10.0.0.2

- Open a new terminal and run the mininet.js application. In this case, it is in our home directory
$ nodejs mininet.js

Step 5: Open up sflow-rt in your browser
- Go to this address: http://127.0.0.1:8008/html/index.html
Click on "apps", then click on dashboard-example

There you go! That should do it for the first part of this project!
